     <h2>Introducing Social Products</h2>
    <p>
Kynetx helps companies build products and services that talk to their users. When products become social, you can have a relationship with them, just like the relationship you have with your friends. And products can even have relationships with their manufacturer, their servicer, and even other people. Social products, connected to their owners and others, greatly enhance the experience of owning and using things. And that's great news for merchants and customers alike.

The Kynetx LiveWeb platform is great for taking action in context because it can tie into multiple disparate systems and make decisions based on the data that they provide to improve business processes. LiveWeb is designed and built from the ground up for interoperability, so it can flexibly work with any sources, targets and workloads.
