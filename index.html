     <h2>Introducing Social Products</h2>
    <p>
Kynetx helps companies build products and services that talk to their users. When products become social, you can have a relationship with them, just like the relationship you have with your friends. And products can even have relationships with their manufacturer, their service provider, and even other people. Social products, connected to their owners and others, greatly enhance the experience of owning and using things. And that's great news for merchants and customers alike.
