  <h1>Case Studies</h1>

  <p>
SquareTag can help brands connect with customers. Here are a few use cases we've worked on with SquareTag.
  </p>
  
<h2>University of Utah Bike Program</h2>

<p><img src="/img/univ_of_utah_200.png"  style="width:200px;" align="right" />
The University of Utah had a problem: when police recovered lost bikes, they had no way to contact the owner. Rather than starting up their own registration program, University Police turned to SquareTag. Multiple times each year, campus police hold bike rodeos and encourage students to put a SquareTag on their bike. Now when police find a bike with a SquareTag, they simple scan the tag and are immediately presented with a contact form. Others who scan the tag simply get a short message without revealing any personal information. 
</p>

<p>
SquareTag has the ability to present different people with different experiences because of its unique decentralized architecture that allows unique relationships between things, people, and organizations. University police get one experience, owners get another, and everyone else gets a short message. What's more, SquareTag let students control their own personal information so that it's always up to date. 
</p>


<h2>LiveCar</h2>

<p><img src="/img/livecar_65.png" style="width:200px;" hspace="10" align="right" />
LiveCar is a forthcoming product from Kynetx that's built on SquareTag. LiveCar gives cars a voice so they can talk to their owners and tell them where it's at, how fast it's going, when it needs maintenance, what trips it's been on, what that "check engine" light means, and more. 
</p>

<p>
LiveCar uses SquareTag's social product capabilities to manage interactions between the car, its owners, its drivers, and the companies that service it. SquareTag's decentralized architecture, along with it's support for evented interactions, mean that the car and everything else can be modeled more realistically and real-time interactions, alerts, and notifications are easy to program. 
</p>

<p>
LiveCar demonstrates how connected products, like the OBD II device it uses, can use SquareTag as a complete platform for building out an Internet of Things strategy. Rather than starting from scratch, SquareTag let's IoT vendors build on top of a capable and proven system that eases the programmer's task and speeds time to market.
